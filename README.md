# üîê Log File Analyzer (Security+ Project)

A simple Python script that scans Linux-style authentication logs (`auth.log`) to identify any failed login attempts while simultaneously flagging suspicious IP addresses.

This project is part of my hands-on preparation for the **CompTIA Security+ certification**, focusing on log analysis and basic threat detection techniques.

---

## üìå Key Features

- Parses authentication logs (e.g., `auth.log`)
- Identifies failed login attempts
- Tracks and counts attempts by IP address
- Highlights IPs with repeated failures
- Easy to customize or extend

---

## üß† Why It Matters (Security+ Tie-In)

This tool reinforces concepts from **Security+ Domain 2 (Technologies and Tools)**, specifically:

- Log analysis
- Detection of potential brute-force attempts
- Security monitoring fundamentals

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Prepare a Log File

If you're using a simulated log file, run:

```bash
nano sample_auth.log
```
Then paste the following example log contents:

```bash
Mar 27 10:15:43 localhost sshd[1001]: Failed password for invalid user root from 192.168.1.100 port 22 ssh2
Mar 27 10:16:10 localhost sshd[1001]: Failed password for user admin from 192.168.1.101 port 22 ssh2
Mar 27 10:16:45 localhost sshd[1001]: Accepted password for user alex from 192.168.1.102 port 22 ssh2
Mar 27 10:17:12 localhost sshd[1001]: Failed password for root from 192.168.1.100 port 22 ssh2
Mar 27 10:18:03 localhost sshd[1001]: Failed password for root from 192.168.1.103 port 22 ssh2
```
Save and exit the file: CTRL+O, Enter, CTRL+X

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Script

1. Make sure you have **Python 3 installed**:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
   
2. Run Script with sample log file:
   ```bash
   python3 log_analyzer.py
   ```

3. Output is a breakdown of the failed login attempts by IP with repeated failed being flagged
  ```yaml
  üîê Failed Login Attempts by IP:
  192.168.1.100: 2 attempt(s)
  192.168.1.101: 1 attempt(s)
  192.168.1.103: 1 attempt(s)
  
  üö® Suspicious IPs (multiple failures):
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  192.168.1.100 - 2 times
  ```
